6.Time Travel
Einstein's theory of relativity provides the theoretical basis for the imagination of "time travel." In recent years, with the proliferation of novels and films about "time travel," many people have strange thoughts: if I traveled back to the past and became my past self, would I change my original choices?
I never thought about this, but today, I seem to have time traveled. Although it was only traveling back a few hours, I still made some different decisions.
I walked to Manager Sun's office: "Ms Sun, I have plans after work today. I need to leave at 5 o'clock and might not be able to wait until the meeting ends."
My words startled her, and she looked at me with confusion. It seemed that my refusal to work overtime was something that shocked her.
"Well, um, what plans do you have? We have an important meeting later. I hope everyone in our team can attend."
Important my ass. I've already heard it once, just the same few circular statements repeated over and over.
"Don't worry, Ms Sun. I'll ask other colleagues for the meeting minutes tomorrow morning. I promise it won't affect my work."
I didn't answer what plans I had. My after-work plans are none of her business.
She seemed to encounter this situation for the first time and didn't know how to respond, so she waved her hand and let me go.
When it was time to leave work, while other team members were listlessly listening to Manager Sun's circular talk, I stood up on time, ignored Manager Sun's displeased gaze, and walked out of the office amid my teammates' astonishment. I needed to leave that depressing place.
I walked out of the office building and breathed in the outdoor air, which was mixed with car exhaust and the smell of barbecue stalls. At this moment, I was certain that this was reality.
In reality, there's my lovely wife Ruoli and my son Xiaobao. In reality, there's no desert cave, no giant face, and no Wu Wei. Walking on the way home, I passed over a bridge and entered an underground passage. I kept thinking about one question: whether to update my novel. Wu Wei seemed to be quite popular in the novel; would his death affect the readership?
"Ah!" With a scream from someone nearby, I seemed to have stepped on something soft. Looking down, I saw it was a human hand. A beggar's hand. His hand was too dirty, not just the hand, but also dirty clothes, dirty hair, covering a dirty face.
This dirty beggar was kneeling on the ground. Under the dim light of the underground passage, he almost blended with the dirty ground, indeed difficult to notice. I felt apologetic, lowered my head to ask if his hand was injured, while taking out my wallet to give him some money as compensation.
The beggar seemed not to hear what I said and suddenly stretched out both hands, grabbing my trouser leg. I was startled and tried to retreat, but he held me tightly.
He slowly raised his head, and from the dirty hair emerged two eyes that I was all too familiar with. This beggar was actually Wu Wei. Just as I was shocked and at a loss, this Wu Wei spoke: "Give me some water to drink."
I broke down, using all my strength to break free from the hands holding my trouser leg, staggering out of the passage, not daring to look back, running wildly all the way. Perhaps running so fast in a suit and leather shoes was uncommon, as passersby all turned their gaze toward me. Let them look, I couldn't care about anything else now except escaping.
No one was at home. I rushed into the bedroom, locked the door, leaned against it, panting heavily, my heart beating uncontrollably.
How is this possible? How could a beggar be Wu Wei, and even say Wu Wei's last words before his death? Wu Wei was clearly a fictional character I created in my novel; he shouldn't exist in this world.
"Bang!" The front door outside was opened. Someone came in. I was still in fear, but I forced myself to calm down. Silently telling myself, this is my own home, what am I afraid of? I unlocked the door and suddenly opened the bedroom door. Standing in front of us were Ruoli and Xiaobao. Ruoli was wearing white work clothes, and Xiaobao was holding a green box.
That strange box still made me feel uncomfortable, but seeing my wife and child standing in front of me, I felt much calmer.
"Watch Xiaobao, I'll take a shower first," Ruoli said, then turned and went to the bathroom.
Xiaobao went to his room and opened that box.
A scream came from Ruoli in the bathroom.
I went to the bathroom and killed that big cockroach.
At night, when sleeping, Ruoli clung tightly to me.
But I couldn't sleep. I kept my eyes open, not knowing what would happen if I closed them. I was worried that when I closed my eyes and opened them again, the person beside me would no longer be Ruoli.
The wall clock was ticking, and the night grew deeper. Beside me, Ruoli suddenly hummed. After a few minutes, she hummed again. I turned to look at her and, by the light from outside, saw her lips moving, saying something. This was the first time I had seen her talk in her sleep. I moved my ear closer to carefully listen to what she was saying. Finally, amidst a series of intermittent sounds, I clearly heard five words: "Give me some water to drink."
