4. The Gaze of the Abyss
When you question a dream while in the dream, the sensations within suddenly become very real, making it impossible to distinguish whether it truly is a dream. I thought I was still dreaming, but everything around me insisted otherwise. I desperately searched for inconsistencies in my physical sensations: the air thick with suffocating dust, the waves of hunger in my stomach, and on my arm, around the wound that Wei had cut open, blood beginning to coagulate. I gently touched the wound, which sent another sharp pain. Everything felt too real. Just as I was giving up the search for inconsistencies and preparing to accept this as reality, the "inconsistency" revealed itself.
"Ah!" From the abyss beneath our feet, a sudden sigh emerged. The sound was loud, too loud to be human. Wei heard it too, and as we both peered down into the depths, a terrifying sight appeared: directly below us, in the endless darkness, a pair of eyes suddenly opened. Those eyes, devoid of any emotion, stared directly at me.
Before we could react, the rock we were standing on suddenly cracked. I felt an intense sensation of weightlessness as I plunged headfirst into the abyss.
As our falling speed increased, the distance between us and the two eyes grew shorter, the eyes becoming larger and larger. Finally, the two of us fell precisely into the two large "eyeballs."
The "eyeballs" were certainly filled with water, very deep water. Though we survived the fall, the impact of my head hitting the water surface was extremely painful. It felt like an iron hammer striking my head heavily, making me see stars and feel dizzy. My ears heard only the bubbling sound of water; opening my eyes, darkness surrounded me, and I could see nothing. I completely lost my sense of direction, unable even to differentiate up from down. With clothes soaked in water, it was nearly impossible to feel buoyancy, I would be trapped to death in this "eyeball."
Just as the oxygen in my lungs was about to be depleted, I spotted light in the endless darkness, a tiny point emitting very faint light. Even such weak light was enough to give me hope in the darkness. I swam desperately toward that point and finally reached the surface. Being able to breathe air again felt wonderful.
With no time for reflection, I immediately climbed out of the water, turned on my flashlight, and pointed it toward the other eyeball where Wei remained.
Fortunately, he too was alive. He emerged from the water, gasping for breath while looking at me in terror: "Are we really dreaming?"
He had begun to question as well. I didn't know how to answer him because I didn't know either.
I removed my soaked outer clothing and walked to a protruding rock to observe our surroundings:
We were in a space surrounded by rock walls. The space wasn't large, and where I stood seemed to be the center. A few steps away were two pools of water, where the water glowed because each contained what looked like a full moon. Above the pools at an angle was a real full moon hanging in the sky, shining through a small hole in the rock wall into the two pools. What had saved my life, guiding me out of the water, was this moon in the sky.
We understood the principle of the "eyes": when the moon moved to a certain position, moonlight would shine through the small hole in the rock wall onto the water's surface. The water would reflect the moon's light, and thus the "eyes" would open. During daytime, if sunlight passed through the hole into the cave, it would likely be brighter here.
Where there is sunlight and water, naturally plants will grow. Just a few meters in front of the two pools was a dense patch of herbaceous plants. They weren't green but a strange purplish-black color. The stems were winding and twisted, with heart-shaped leaves...
I suddenly thought of that box. The pattern on top resembled a cockroach, and the pattern on the side was this very plant.
"I recognize this. It's sweet potato vine! It's edible!"
Wei had already rushed over, grabbed a handful of leaves, and stuffed them into his mouth.
We hadn't eaten since falling into this cave. Watching Wei devour the leaves ravenously, my stomach also sent intense hunger pangs. As I walked over, also wanting to pick some leaves to satisfy my hunger, Wei suddenly reached out to me: "Give me some water to drink."
That was the last thing I heard him say.
Just as I was about to go to the pool to get water for him, I noticed his mouth, still forcefully chewing the leaves, suddenly freeze. Then his eyes began to fill with blood, and his expression turned horrifyingly grotesque. With a thud, his body fell backward, crashing heavily to the ground. Immediately after, his body began to convulse violently, and purplish-black liquid started seeping from the corners of his mouth. The convulsions lasted only a few seconds before he stopped moving entirely.
My mind went blank. Everything happened so suddenly that before I could even react, it was already over. I tremblingly approached Wei's side and reached out to feel the arterial pulse in his neck. Nothing. Wei was dead.
