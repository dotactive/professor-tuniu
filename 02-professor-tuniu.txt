2. Sage Tuna
I am Sage Tuna. 'Tuna' is my family name. And as for the title "Sage", in Chinese culture, anyone with even a tiny bit of fame or expertise gets respectfully addressed as "Sage".
I'm a low-level employee at a tech company and a part-time online novelist in China. I've published a few fantasy novels on a well-known fiction website and gained some attention. But in recent years, China's Internet Censorship System has become increasingly unfriendly to writers, with fiction websites enforcing stricter and stricter content reviews, and fantasy novels being hit the hardest. I had a novel with just over ten thousand words written for the introduction, but even after repeatedly self-censoring it several times, it still didn't pass review. With no other choice, I had to switch to a new publishing platform and start over.
After hearing a few readers call me "Sage," I quite liked the feeling, so on this new platform, I registered "Sage Tuna" as my pen name.
My ability to work as an online writer is a gift from heaven. I often have dreams with bizarre and twisted plots, and each night's dream continues from the previous night's dream. After waking up, I can clearly remember everything from the dream. So when I write novels, I don't need to rack my brains to come up with plots—I just need to write down what happened in my dreams.
That segment I just dreamed about still feels terrifying when I think about it now. The more terrifying it is, the more readers like it. So I satisfyingly recalled the events from my dream, quietly got out of bed, and went to my study to turn on the computer and start writing. I typed while recalling, and by the time I finished and clicked publish, it was already morning.
"You got up in the middle of the night to write novels again. I haven't seen you in the morning for several days in a row," my wife Ruoli was already standing at the study door complaining. She was dressed in white work attire. She must have an important meeting today to be wearing that outfit.
"Alright, in the future I'll try to finish writing quickly and come back to keep you company before you wake up."
After comforting her with a few words, I quickly washed up and headed out to work. My office job is simple and boring—paying the company's bills, constantly receiving calls from debt collectors, and finding various excuses to delay payment for as long as possible.
In the afternoon, I received another call. As I picked up the phone, I had already prepared many excuses to delay payment, but no one spoke on the other end. After saying "hello" a few times and about to hang up, a voice that was extremely hoarse and indistinguishable as male or female suddenly came through:
"That box, don't open it!"
"Huh?" I was confused by this random statement. "What box?"
There was no answer from the other end; they just hung up.
I put down the phone, somewhat understanding what had happened.
The novel I published this morning mentioned that box, and now I was receiving this call during the day. It must be some bored reader. What disgusted me was that they somehow got my company's phone number.
All Chinese novel websites require real-name verification, authors must provide their actual ID information to publish novels, but the sites can't guarantee the security of this private information. Once ID information is leaked, it's as if everything about me is exposed. I immediately called the novel website to question them about my information being leaked, but their response was that their information security was excellent and there was no leak.
Of course, without direct evidence, they wouldn't admit it. I even suspected they might be actively selling authors' information. But what could I do? I had to swallow my pride. That's the price of makeing this money?
The disgusting incidents didn't end there. Just as I was calling the novel website, a message popped up in the work group chat:
Financial Department Manager Sun: Meeting today at 4:45 regarding recent work arrangements. (2022-10-10)
The department manager deliberately scheduled a meeting just before the end of the workday, talking about a bunch of nonsense completely irrelevant to me. Not just irrelevant to me, but seemingly irrelevant to everyone at the meeting. She gathered everyone for a meeting just to delay time, creating a false impression that our department was working hard overtime, putting on a show for her superiors.
By the time I got home, Ruoli had already finished work and picked up Bao from kindergarten. Bao had already changed clothes, but Ruoli was still wearing her white work outfit.
"Watch Bao. I'm going to take a shower first," Ruoli said before turning and heading to the bathroom.
I eagerly went to Bao's room. Whenever I was in a bad mood, just seeing my child's innocent, adorable eyes would instantly cheer me up. But today was different—seeing Bao didn't make me happy because his innocent eyes were fixed on something: a box.
A green paper box with heart-shaped leaves printed all around it, and on the lid was an oval pattern resembling a cockroach's body.
"Don't touch that box!" I immediately rushed over, wanting to grab the box and keep it away from my son.
When Bao saw me trying to take his box, he immediately hugged it and pulled in the opposite direction. He pulled so hard that the glass on the table fell onto the floor.
With a "crash," the glass shattered all over the floor.
Ignoring the broken glass on the ground, I first asked Bao: "Where did this box come from?"
Bao: "Childcare."
Me: "Who gave it to you?"
Bao: "Bao made the box."
Knowing the box wasn't given to him by someone else, I felt relieved. Bao often makes crafts in Childcare; perhaps making a box today was just a coincidence.
I carried Bao to the bed and began cleaning up the broken glass. Sitting on the bed, he still clutched the box tightly. I disposed of the broken glass in the outdoor trash bin as quickly as possible. When I returned to Bao's room, he had already opened the lid. The box was empty inside.
"That box, don't open it!"
At that moment, I suddenly recalled the "harassment call" from that afternoon, and an ominous feeling grew in my heart.
"Ahhhh!"
A sudden scream from Ruoli came from the bathroom.
I rushed to the bathroom where Ruoli was pressed against the shower wall, wrapped in a towel, her eyes wide with terror. Following her gaze, I saw a palm-sized cockroach crawling on the wall on the other side of the bathroom.
